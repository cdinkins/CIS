# CIS
Midterm Project for CIS

Instructions:
As part of any software development you should use source control.
Create a shared code base for some simple piece of software; you can create it or you could upload some code from someplace else.
Watch the following video and chose one of the system mention (or another that may have come along recently).
Provide screen shots of each member accessing the shared source on their computer.
Provide screen shots of each member making a change to the code that is then reflected in the other member's code.
Write a one page paper listing the steps taken to complete the setup and how the sharing worked for them.
Include screen shots shared from you and your group.

Each member must turn in an original document detailing their experiences with the software; only screen shots should be the same.
